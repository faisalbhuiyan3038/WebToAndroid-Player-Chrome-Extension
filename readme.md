# WebToAndroid Player Chrome Extension
NOTE: THIS EXTENSION IS NOT MEANT FOR DESKTOP WINDOWS/MAC USERS. IT'S BUILT FOR ANDROID USERS.

Which Android browser supports extensions?
Many, including Kiwi Browser, Lemur Browser, Quetta Browser, Edge Canary, Mask Browser etc.

What does this extension do?
It detects streaming m3u8 or mp4 videos on the current site and if found will show a small play icon on the bottom right corner. When you tap it, you can find the list of detected streams. Clicking on each stream will open Android's native sharing menu where you can choose the app you want to open the video in. That's it! You can watch them in your favorite player with all the features the app supports like audio equalizer, swipe to seek etc.

Which video players are supported?
Any video player that supports opening streaming links will work. I tested with mpv and SVPlayer.

Why is this not on the Chrome Web Store?
Creating a developer account requires a registration fee and I am not able to bear the cost yet.

If there is any issues, please create a github issue and I will take a look at it when I am free.
